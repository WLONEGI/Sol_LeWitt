  "WGI_Physical_Science": "IPCC AR6 WGI Report Summary:\n- Warming is unequivocal and human-induced.\n- Global surface temperature increased by 1.09°C (2011-2020 vs 1850-1900).\n- SSP scenarios predict 1.4°C to 4.4°C warming by 2100.\n- Sea level rise is irreversible for centuries.",
  "WGII_Impacts_Adaptation": "IPCC AR6 WGII Report Summary:\n- 3-14% of terrestrial species at very high extinction risk at 1.5°C.\n- Coral reefs: 70-90% loss at 1.5°C, >99% at 2°C.\n- 1 billion people in coastal areas at flood risk by 2050.\n- Climate Resilient Development (CRD) is the integrated path forward.",
  "WGIII_Mitigation": "IPCC AR6 WGIII Report Summary:\n- Emissions must peak before 2025 for 1.5°C.\n- 43% reduction by 2030, Net Zero CO2 by early 2050s.\n- Solar and wind costs dropped 85% and 55% respectively (2010-2019).\n- Mitigation costs are economically feasible (half < $20/tCO2e).",
