# Mode-specific Planning Guidance: Comic & Character Sheet

- `comic_page_render`:
  - panel flow, action readability, and dialogue placement first
  - include shot intention and continuity hints
- `character_sheet_render`:
  - set `layout_type` to `other` (fixed)
  - style source is `story_framework`, identity source is `character_sheet`
  - if `layout_template_id` exists in input, use template-first planning
  - generation_notes should focus on immutable identity lock (face/hair/body/costume anchors)
